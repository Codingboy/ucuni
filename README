How to read the documentation

If you do not know the the code working behind a function very well you shall read each "shall" in its documentation like a "must".
If you do not do that the behaviour of the program is not defined.
Each precondition is to be read like a "shall" (-> "must").
If you are operating on pins the microcontroller does not have (for example C0), the behaviour of the program is not defined.
In general if you give a function a nullpointer as input the programs behaviour will be undefined if it is not explicitly said that a nullpointer is allowed.
Better only use the functions and do not manipulate the atmega register in your own. It may have sideeffects to some functions and the behaviour will be undefined.
